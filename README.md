## Overview of Statistical Analysis

The overall goal of this project is to analyze weather data so that the investors can make an informed decision regarding the financial success of opening a new surf and icecream shop. 

## Results
The three key differences between weather in June and December are: 
1)There are more data points for June (count= 1,700) compared to December (count=1,517)
2) The mean temperature for December (71.0)  is lower than for June (74.9).
3) The temperature ranges from a minimum of 64 in June to maximum of 85 . In December the temperature range is higher, it ranges from a minimum of 56 to a maximum of 83. 

## Summary
Overall the temperatures in June are slightly higher than those in December but overall the temperature durin gboth months is within a reasonable range with the minmum of 56 in December to a maximum of 85 in June. In order to help with the decision, I would recommend 1) a similar analysis to determine the summary statisitics for precipitation during the two months; 2) look at these values for other months; 3)determine the number of days during the year when the temperature and preceipation are at levels that are thought to be most conducive for surfing.
